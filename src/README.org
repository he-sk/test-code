* test_buffer_allocation [2017-05-06 Sa]

- Test number and size of OpenCL buffers that can be allocated according to
  best practices described by NVIDIA and AMD.
- [[http://www.nvidia.com/content/cudazone/cudabrowser/downloads/papers/nvidia_opencl_bestpracticesguide.pdf][NVIDIA OpenCL Best Practices Guide]] (version 1.0, ยง3.1.1, Pinned Memory)
- [[http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/opencl-optimization-guide/#50401315_pgfId-517669][AMD OpenCL Optimization Guide]] (ยง1.6.2, Application Scenarios and Recommended OpenCL Paths)

Results:
- =clCreateBuffer= can accept buffer sizes that exceed the buffer size
  of the device
- =CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE= is raised on =clEnqueueMapBuffer=
  and/or =clEnqueueWriterBuffer=
- It seems that the allocated buffer can exceed
  =CL_DEVICE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE=
- However, because two buffers are needed, only half of the device
  memory can be used.
- Tested on NVIDIA Quadro K2100M [2017-05-04 Do]
